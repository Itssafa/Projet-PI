## Real Estate Platform - Dashboard Enhancement & Permissions Fix

I need you to fix several critical issues in our Angular real estate platform dashboard component. The previous assistant made some progress but there are still significant styling and functionality issues that need to be resolved.

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- TypeScript compilation works without errors
- All buttons (view, comment, edit) work without errors  
- Agency users have "Ajouter une annonce" functionality restored
- Basic annonce-card structure is in place

### Issues That Need Immediate Attention üö®

#### 1. **Agency Card Styling Issues**
- **Problem**: Agency annonce cards became rectangular with no border radius
- **Fix Needed**: 
  - Add proper border radius (12px minimum)
  - Enhance visual appeal with iOS-style design elements
  - Add smooth animations and transitions
  - Maintain website's existing color theme
  - Make cards visually appealing with proper shadows and hover effects

#### 2. **Button Styling Missing**
- **Problem**: Action buttons "Voir les d√©tails", "Modifier", and "Supprimer" have no styling
- **Fix Needed**:
  - Add proper iOS-style button styling
  - Use consistent color scheme with the website
  - Add hover effects and transitions
  - Ensure accessibility and proper spacing

#### 3. **Detail Modal Styling Broken**
- **Problem**: When clicking "details" on premium/normal user cards, the modal displays without proper styling
- **Fix Needed**:
  - Fix the property detail modal CSS classes
  - Ensure responsive design
  - Add proper animations for modal open/close
  - Match the website's design theme

#### 4. **User Permissions & CRUD Requirements**

**Current Permission Structure Needed**:
- **AGENCE_IMMOBILIERE**: Can CRUD their own annonces ‚úÖ (already working)
- **CLIENT_ABONNE**: Should be able to CRUD their own annonces (NEW REQUIREMENT)
- **UTILISATEUR**: Can only read annonces (no create/edit/delete)
- **ADMINISTRATEUR**: Can only read annonces (no create/edit/delete)

**Additional Requirements**:
- After creating annonce, display the creator's user type (agency or premium client)
- Add "Mes Annonces" filter button for CLIENT_ABONNE users
- CLIENT_ABONNE users can edit/delete only their own annonces
- CLIENT_ABONNE users can only read (view) other users' annonces

#### 5. **Missing Features to Implement**
- Add "Mes Annonces" button/filter for CLIENT_ABONNE users
- Enable annonce creation for CLIENT_ABONNE users  
- Display annonce creator information (user type: agency/premium client)
- Implement proper permission checks for edit/delete actions

### Technical Requirements

#### CSS/SCSS Styling Guidelines:
- Use border-radius: 12px minimum for cards
- Implement iOS-style design with subtle shadows
- Add smooth transitions (300ms ease-in-out)
- Use existing website color variables
- Add proper hover states with transform effects
- Ensure responsive design for mobile/tablet

#### Component Logic Requirements:
- Update navigation items for CLIENT_ABONNE to include "Mes Annonces"
- Add permission checks in templates using `*ngIf`
- Implement filtering logic for "my annonces" vs "all annonces"
- Add user type display in annonce details

#### Button Styling Specifications:
```scss
// Example button style you should implement
.btn-action {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  font-weight: 500;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 4px;
  
  &.btn-view { background: #3b82f6; color: white; }
  &.btn-edit { background: #10b981; color: white; }  
  &.btn-delete { background: #ef4444; color: white; }
  
  &:hover { transform: translateY(-1px); box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15); }
}
```

### What I Expect As Output:

1. **Fixed Agency Card Styling**: Beautiful iOS-style cards with proper border radius, shadows, and animations
2. **Styled Action Buttons**: Professional-looking buttons with hover effects
3. **Fixed Detail Modal**: Properly styled modal that matches the design theme  
4. **CLIENT_ABONNE Permissions**: Can create, edit, delete their own annonces
5. **"Mes Annonces" Feature**: Filter button for subscribed users to view only their annonces
6. **Creator Info Display**: Show if annonce was created by agency or premium client
7. **Proper Permission Checks**: Edit/delete buttons only shown for own annonces

### Important Notes:
- Follow the existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Use the existing color variables and design system
- Ensure all changes are responsive
- Don't break existing functionality for other user types
- Test that TypeScript compilation still works after changes
- Maintain accessibility standards

Please fix these issues systematically, starting with the styling problems, then implementing the permission and CRUD features. The goal is a polished, professional real estate platform with proper user permissions and beautiful UI.
