Ok the backend runs successfully ! 
The comment is added in the backend as a subscribed user, but the comment is not displayed . only the evaluation is, and the number of how many comments, is there in the card.

The evaluation button and the comment button are seperated, while when i evaluate i have to comment first, so i do both.

The major problem is that the comment is not displayed , also, when i connect with agency account, i don't see notification, neither the comment in the card of mes biens when i check the same annonce. it have no section to show that a user (with its name) have commented it.

Please fix !
